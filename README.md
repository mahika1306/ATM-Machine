# ATM-Machine

The "Simple ATM Machine" project is a console-based Java application that simulates a basic Automated Teller Machine (ATM). It allows users to perform standard banking operations such as checking account balance, depositing money, and withdrawing funds. The application supports both new user registration and existing user login using a PIN-based authentication system.
This project demonstrates fundamental Java programming concepts, such as working with classes and objects, utilizing data structures like HashMap to manage user data, and implementing a simple menu-driven user interface. It provides a basic implementation of an ATM system suitable for learning purposes or as a starting point for more advanced banking applications.
